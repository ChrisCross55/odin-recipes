    <h3>Mexico's answer to pulled pork</h3>
    <p>Carnitas is an extremely popular dish in Mexico. It is traditionally
        made by cooking tough cuts of pork in lard until it is extremely tender
        and the exterior is browned and caramelized. They go great in a taco topped with
        pickled onions or in a torta with onions and cilantro.
