        <h3>A Thanksgiving staple thats great year-round</h3>
        <p>
            Mashed Potatoes is considered a comfort food to many Americans. 
            A Thanksgiving dinner doesn't feel complete without it. Mashed potatoes 
            can be a very simple dish consisting of few ingredients or a complex dish
            involving much more, but at its core it simply consists of boiled potatoes 
            being mashed and typically mixed with butter and milk.

            <ol>

                <li>Roughly quarter potatoes</li>
                <li>Once water is boiling, add potatoes and salt into the water</li>
                <li>After fifteen minutes, check potatoes with a knife or fork for doneness.
                    You should be able to stick the knife or fork into a chunk with relative ease.
                    If ready, set aside a cup of the water and drain the rest
                
                </li>
                <li>Add butter and milk to the potatoes and mash</li>
                <li>Add salt and pepper to taste and if consistency is too thick, add a splash of reserved water</li>
